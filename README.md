# Agricultural-advisory-services-and-Farmer-collaboration-system
Android and Firebase mobile application providing agricultural advisory services and farmer collaboration with the Department of Agriculture.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Internet of Things is a concept; it is a network, the true technology-enabled Network of all networks." â€” Edewede Oriwoh<p>

<p>We are now in world filled with new technologies and some are still emerging. In the current world almost, everything is connected to each other virtually because of the Internet.<p>
<p>
In Sri Lanka, almost everyone is having smartphones that are connected to the internet. Then we realized that farmers are struggling to find solutions for the problems, especially regarding farming matters. Sometimes they may have to visit the Agricultural Departments' offices and stay in ques for several hours scarifying their valuable time in search of solutions to the problems. However, sometimes they may not get the solution after all dedications and/or farmers may have to wait for officer to visit the farming areas and give the solutions.
<p>
<p>  
Considering all the facts we decided to give those innocent farmers who sacrifice their life for providing food required for all the people in the country. Since almost all the farmers (except for traditional ones) are having smartphones on their hand we decided to give them mobile-based application which can easily be accessed and used to contact the officers at any time without waiting in ques.<p>

<p>At the same time, the officers who are responsible for providing solutions to the farmers can use this application to address the farmer's problems easily. Based on the problem officers can provide solutions at the moment by using the app. But if it is not possible, they can contact the farmers and provide the solutions to the farmers.
